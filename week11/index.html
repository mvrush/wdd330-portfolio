        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p>
            This week we studied browser-side form validation. We also studied how to use the Fetch() API. I've done browser-side form validation many times in the past and it was very easy to grasp.
            <br>
            The important thing to remember is where to find info on client-side form validation. A helpful resource is at mdn web docs. Here's the link, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation">Client Side Form Validation</a>.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I also went in-depth on the Fetch API. I have used it before but never had a very good grasp of it. This weeks study really helped me in that regard.
            <br>
            Again, the important thing to remember is where to find info on the Fetch API. A helpful resource is at mdn web docs. Here's the link, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">Using the Fetch API</a>.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally I worked on the Quakes activity which was also part of the team activity. This was one of those activities where I feel like I missed a class lecture or something. To be honest, I was pretty lost on it and still don't really understand the teacher solution. My team did pretty well with it though.
            <br>
            But, I really understood the Fetch API it was using and how it was pulling data from the USGS Earthquake Catalog. So at least there's that.
        </p>
        

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p>
            One thing I don't really understand are Promises. When you recieve a promise, what is it exactly? Is it just a response from the API that they have received your request? Is is the actual data you've requested? Is it sort of like a handshake from a modem when you are first trying to establish a connection?
        </p>
