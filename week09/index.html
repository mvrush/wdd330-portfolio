        <h1>WDD 330 Week 09</h1>
        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p>
            This week we studied Chapter 9 "The Window Object" and Chapter 14 "HTML5 API's" from JavaScript: Novice to Ninja.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I got a lot more information on localStorage from this chapter. To clear everything in localStorage you can use the <b>clear()</b> method. If you're working on a page using localStorage and you need to clear it quickly you can simply run <b>localStorage.clear()</b> from the browser console.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Another note on localStorage is that it's tied to the domain that's calling it. That's how the browser knows which part of localStorage to load. It matches the domain to the area of localStorage tied to that domain.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Brother Chandler pointed out that Google Chrome records Web storage data in a SQLite file in the user's profile. The subfolder containing this file is " \AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Local Storage " on Windows, and " ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local Storage " on macOS.
            <br>
        </p>
        

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p>
            A question I had is: when using <b>clear()</b> on localStorage does it clear everything in localStorage? Or does it only clear the part of localStorage that is tied to the domain that issued the <b>clear()</b> function?
        </p>
