        <h1>WDD 330 Week 09</h1>
        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p>
            This week I really immersed myself in the reading. I found the usage of Canvas fascinating. It's interesting to me how we can manipulate pixels and even video with JavaScript. I found the code use Canvas to be surprisingly simple especially when compared with the code for SVG.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, drawing a rectangle with a stroke and fill is as easy as the following code:
            <br>
            In the HTML page we would use the code:<br>
            <b>        &lt;canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200">
                Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas. (If it did there would be a rectangle here).
                &lt;/canvas></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the JavaScript file we sould then simply use the following code:<br>
            <b>
            var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas"); var context = canvas.getContext("2d");<br>
            context.strokeStyle = "red";context.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)";<br>
            context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);<br>
            context.strokeRect(10, 10, 100, 100);
            </b>
        <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here it is in action:
            <br>
        </p>
        <canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="150" height="150">
            Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas. (If it did there would be a rectangle here).
        </canvas>
        <p>
            I also spent a lot of time working with the SWAPI api before, during and after the team assignment. I found that using Postman was an easy and convenient way to interact with the API to see what kind of data I would be working with.
            <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p>
            A question I had from this week's work concerns the async/await commands. I am not sure exactly how to incorporate them into my code for the API.
        </p>
