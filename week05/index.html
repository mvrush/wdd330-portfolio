        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>
            This week from the reading I was able to pick up some new testing and debugging methods. One of the more useful methods was to employ the alert() to effectively stop a program from executing at some point until the alert is clicked. It's a handy way to stop program execution.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I also got a lot of information on Error Objects and how to create them. We use error objects with a constructor function to create custom error objects. For example we can use the <b>TypeError()</b> to show when a string is used but a number was expected. Here's the example:<br>
            <b>const error = new TypeError('You need to use numbers in this function');</b><br>
            When a type mismatch is detected the error will be thrown.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I also went more in-depth on the browser console's built-in debugging tool. I found it very handy to insert breakpoints into my code to check it's functionality while running.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I did a lot of studying on how to get my ToDo list to work. I have really been struggling with it because it is using a lot of functionality that I only have a very basic knowledge of. I spent many more hours than I probably should have on it.
        </p>

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Questions Part One:</b> Why do we use modules besides cutting down clutter in our main code? Does it reduce the number of script calls when a webpage loads? Is there some sort of speed increase?
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Questions Part Two:</b> How do I keep the footer on my portfolio page at the bottom of the screen? It is resizing to the content of the page and appears halway up the screen on large screens.
            <br>
