        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>
            This week from the reading I was able to pick up some new testing and debugging methods. One of the more useful methods was to employ the alert() to effectively stop a program from executing at some point until the alert is clicked. It's a handy way to stop program execution.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I also got a lot of information on Error Objects and how to create them. We use error objects with a constructor function to create custom error objects. For example we can use the <b>TypeError()</b> to show when a string is used but a number was expected. Here's the example:<br>
            <b>const error = new TypeError('You need to use numbers in this function');</b><br>
            When a type mismatch is detected the error will be thrown.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I also went more in-depth on the browser console's built-in debugging tool. I found it very handy to insert breakpoints into my code to check it's functionality while running.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I did a lot of studying on how to get my ToDo list to work. I have really been struggling with it because it is using a lot of functionality that I only have a very basic knowledge of. I spent many more hours than I probably should have on it.
        </p>

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p>
            I am having a problem right now with feeling like I don't have the knowledge I need to complete stretch goals in the team assignments or the to complete the ToDo list. I look at examples of code and just feel lost in a lot of it. I'm struggling with the simplest things like how to access the data in a JavaScript object.
        </p>
