        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p>
            I spent a bunch of time trying to create an event listener that would listen for a 'touchend' event and then fall back to 'click' for people who are using a mouse.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am still having a difficult time wrapping my mind around the concept of callbacks. The simple definition is, <b>"Callbacks are functions that are passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to.</b>
            <br>
            Another thing I need to remember is that <b>callbacks facilitate asynchrounous programming</b> allowing our code to be run <i>out of order</i> so to speak.
            <br>
            A callback can be created that's invoked when an event happens. The event can be DOM events such as 'click' and 'keyPress', but they can also be events such as the completion of a file download, data returned from a database, or the result of a complex operation. By using callbacks, we ensure that waiting for these tasks to complete doesn't hold up the execution of other parts of the program. Once the task has been completed, the callback will be invoked before returning to the rest of the program.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I used asynchronous programming extensively in my Node.js course and I need to go back to that and look at some of those notes. I think the critical thing for me to practice is to think non-linearly. I tend to fall into the traditional program execution of one line at a time from top to bottom.
        </p>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest question I have is how to create an event listener that listens for a 'touchend' event that falls back to 'click' for people using a mouse. I could not figure that one out.
            <br>
            The second part of this question is, why don't we just always use 'click' instead of 'touchend'? Doesn't it just function the same way on a touchscreen?
        </p>
