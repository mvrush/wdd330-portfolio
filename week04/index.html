        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>
            This week I really worked on implementing the reading from last week. So I did a lot of practice coding with Events and Document Object Model manipulation. I added a lot of notes to my code as well. I have found that adding notes around my code does two things. First, it helps me to be more conscious of the code I am writing. Second, it helps me to remember the things I am coding. It's also a great reference when I have to refer to it in the future.
            <br>
        <p>
            That said, there are many of this weeks notes in my practice code. So I have uploaded my practice code this week. You can see the bulk of my notes in the <i>week04_dom.js</i> and the <i>week04_events.js</i> file.

            You can view my DOM practice page and Events practice pages using the links under "Study Coding" below.

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest question I had this week was how to solve the game logic on the Team Assignment. I think we were on the right track but I can't seem to figure out why it doesn't work. You can see our work by following the Team Assignment link below.
