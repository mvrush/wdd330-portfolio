        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>I felt very comfortable reading this book. It is mostly a review for me. I did find the definition of key value pairs to be important. The example of of a phonebook with the name being the key and the phone number being the value clicked with me.</p>
        <p>From Master Mobile UX video
            “If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it’ll be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither simple, nor beautiful.” - Joel March, The Hipper Element
        </p>
        <p>	“The simple guidline is whatever you are doing – do mobile first.” - Eric Schmidt, World Mobile Congress Keynote 2012</p>
        <p>Mobile traffic is skyrocketing because of the popularity of mobile devices. Mobile devices are replaced on the average every 2 years.</p>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p>One question I had concerning Localstorage is where on your local device is it stored? Is it the hard drive? If so, what directory is it stored in?</p>
